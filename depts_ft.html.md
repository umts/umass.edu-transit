Field Trip Services are available to all University departments and
programs; our vehicles can travel anywhere in New England. Our staff
will plan routes based on your itinerary and the size of the vehicle,
we will also provide cost and travel time estimates.

### Transporting Children ###
Groups that will be transporting children should arrange to have
adequate adult supervision including at least one representative from
the UMass organization sponsoring the trip. UMass buses are not
"school bus certified" and do not have school bus lights.

### Deluxe Coach Service ###
Field Trip Services does not have coach buses but we can provide
some basic information on prices and local vendors. Coach bus companies
usually need 4-8 weeks notice to schedule trips.

### Cost Estimates and Additional Charges ###
When your trip is scheduled you will be given a cost estimate.
Your cost will only exceed this estimate if the driver's day ends more
than half an hour later than expected, side trips are added that
increase the miles traveled or the vehicle requires excessive cleaning
at the end of the day. A cleaning surcharge, typically $40, will be
applied if mopping is necessary.

### Payment Arrangements ###
Payment must be made by University Recharge. Field Trip customers
are sent a Confirmation Form that has a payment section; this form
should be completed and faxed back one week before your trip.
