                  work a minimum of 180 hours each semester. At the beginning of each semester, shifts are assigned to employees around
                  their class schedules. UMTS is now paying $8.00-hour for training and a base starting rate of $9.50-hour with
                  opportunity for advancement.<br>

                    <blockquote>All UMass Transit employees start out as drivers or service workers. But there are many promotional positions available to student employees. For instance, you can become a field trip driver, a trainer, a radio operator, a driver supervisor, or a student staff member. These are supervisory positions, and they can help you gain valuable experience that future employers will be looking for.<br> 
                      <br> 
                      In addition, it is common for employees to work in several different departments. For instance, you can work as a bus driver, van driver, service worker, trainer, and field trip driver. This allows for a very diverse work-week, and creates more money-making opportunities.</blockquote>
