  <p>This file populates the nes items shown on the `news' page of the web site.
  Here's a quick run-down on how the various fields work:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>published</dt>
    <dd>Boolean, no quotes, whether the news item is live yet</dd>

    <dt>posted</dt>
    <dd>A time stamp, yyyy-mm-ddThh:nn (24-hour, local time) that the
        news item was posted at.  News items are shown on the page in
        descending order by posted date/time</dd>

    <dt>start</dt>
    <dd>A time stamp; when the news item should start showing up on the
        news page</dt>

    <dt>end</dt>
    <dd>A time stamp; when the news item should stop being shown on the
        news page</dd>

    <dt>title</dt>
    <dd>A string, quoted; the title of the post</dd>

    <dt>link</dt>
    <dd>Either the special value, null, no quotes, or a string that
        contains a URL that will be put on the post title.</dd>

    <dt>description</dt>
    <dd>Put just a ">" on the field line.  Every line after that until
        the record seperator (which is three hyphens "---" alone on a
        line) will be the body of the news post. You can put any HTML
        in here you like.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Making a change to this file requires a deploy, but you can stage changes,
  schedule end-dates, etc. well ahead of time.</p>
