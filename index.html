<!--NOTE: Users should never get to this page.  It is sym-linked over by Capistrano
    during the deploy process.  The default "index page" that we typically display
    is located in slideshow.html.

    If you wish to switch to/from the "news" version of our site, use the Capistrano
    tasks:
      cap index:news
           -or-
      cap index:slideshow

    This page is provided as a fail-safe in case the Capistrano task goes awry, 
    manually forwarding users to http://umass.edu/transit/news.html

    <p>There is an error in the configuration of our site.  We hope to have it resoved shortly;
    please continue on to our <a href="news.html">News Page</a> for the interim.  Thank you.</p>
