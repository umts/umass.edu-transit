Below are known-issues affecting the [Amherst-area][track] and [Northampton-area][ntrack] bus trackers:

1. Information can be several minutes old.
1. Age of information is not indicated.
1. Not all buses are shown. Please refer to the [schedules][sched] or [trip planner][trip].
1. In certain circumstances, buses may appear on the wrong route.
1. Routes common to multiple regions only appear on one bus tracker.
1. Information in the bus icon pop-up window can be misleading or inaccurate:
    * "Last updated on:" is not when the bus was at its shown location.
    * "Status:" (ON-TIME, LATE, EARLY) is sometimes wrong.
    * "Last Stop:" is sometimes wrong.
1. The [text-only][text] main page is missing route numbers.
1. The [text-only][text] stops pages do not display times for Routes 34 and 35.

Future Plans:

* Improve accuracy of information.
* Indicate age of information.
* Combine all PVTA routes onto one bus tracker.
* Add Routes 34 and 35 to the [text-only version][text].
* Add real-time information to bus stops mobile pages (look for QRCodes at bus stops).

Please [contact PVTA][cpvta] with any questions or suggestions.
